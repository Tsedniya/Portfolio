                <p>Intern at AFRICOM Technologies</p>
                <p>I implemented login, registration, and role-based access control; registered the application on the LinkedIn Developer Portal, then configured LinkedIn authentication in the application. I created login buttons, handled OAuth2 flow, and also created a form for email entry. Generated unique invitation links and sent invitation emails to selected contacts and developed a web scraper focused on extracting currency data from a bank's website, utilizing the XPath model for precise targeting of the relevant elements. Constructed XPath queries that efficiently fetched the live exchange rates and currency information; implemented a scheduling mechanism that updates the information in real time, allowing users to access the latest rates seamlessly.</p>
